  A CSS file for Windows 8 apps that uses the Segoe UI Symbol font.

  The base CSS content was blatantly stolen from Font Awesome.

## Usage

  (I ripped this approach off from Font Awesome, so I might as well leech of their documentation, too.  See the Font Awesome documentation for complete documentation.)

  Add the segoe-ui-symbol.css file to your html:

```
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-css]/segoe-ui-symbol.css">
```
Then you can use icons on any of your html just by adding a class of 'icon-[name]'.  For example, adding the comment icon to a span element would look like this:

```
  <span class="icon-comment"></span>
```
I named the icons based on [Microsoft's Dev Center Article about Segoe UI Symbol.(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj841126.aspx)
